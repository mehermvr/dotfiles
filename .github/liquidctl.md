for controlling the rgb on nzxt, see liquidctl
you can pretty much follow the basic readme on the git page and set up a service to control the lighting for the case. set led1 and led2 to breathing purple

the vengeance dimm rgb can be configured as well, but is "unsafe" and there is a possibility to brick it. probably wont happen. but i can deal with a little rgb gayness for now
